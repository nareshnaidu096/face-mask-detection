**Description:**
Python script for building and training a face mask detection model using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

**Importing Libraries and Modules:** The script starts by importing various Python libraries and modules, including TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and others. These libraries are used for tasks like data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation.

**Configuration Parameters:** It sets some configuration parameters, such as the initial learning rate (INIT_LR), the number of training epochs (EPOCHS), and the batch size (BS).

**Dataset Directory and Categories:** The script specifies the directory where the dataset is located (DIRECTORY) and defines the categories of images, in this case, "with_mask" and "without_mask."

**Loading Images:** It loads and preprocesses the images from the dataset directory. The code goes through each category, reads images, resizes them to (224, 224) pixels, and preprocesses them for the MobileNetV2 model. It stores the images and their corresponding labels (with or without mask) in the data and labels lists.

**One-Hot Encoding Labels:** It performs one-hot encoding on the labels to convert them into a binary format (0s and 1s).

**Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The training set comprises 80% of the data.

**Data Augmentation:** It uses the ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow to apply data augmentation techniques to the training data. Data augmentation helps increase the diversity of the training dataset by applying transformations like rotation, zoom, and shifts.

**Model Architecture:** The script loads the MobileNetV2 model with pre-trained weights, removes the top (classification) layers of the MobileNetV2 model, and constructs a new head for classification. The head consists of average pooling, flattening, and two dense layers.

**Freezing Base Layers:** It freezes the layers of the base model (MobileNetV2) to prevent them from being updated during the initial training.

**Model Compilation:** The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

**Model Training:** The script trains the model using the training data and validation data. It stores the training history in the variable H.

**Model Evaluation:** It evaluates the model's performance on the test set and prints a classification report.

**Saving the Model:** The trained model is saved to a file named "mask_detector.model."

**Plotting Training Metrics:** The script creates a plot of the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs and saves it as "plot.png."
This code is a complete pipeline for building and training a face mask detection model. To run it, you would need to have the required Python libraries installed and provide the dataset in the specified directory.
